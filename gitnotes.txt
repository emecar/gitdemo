===Branching================
When not wanting to affect the main repository, you can fork out a branch and work from there. After you are done you can merge. This allows multiple work on same code base without affecting each other.

1. Create Branch on github GUI called "dev"
2. Make some file changes and then:
	save file
	git add . 
	git commit -m "text"
3. change the name of the local branch to "dev"
	git branch -M dev
